            <p>Becoming a web designer allows you to use your creativity, following briefs and putting your own
                individual spin and style on them. Most projects you'll be given will have a particular deadline and
                task outline, but the reason you've been hired is because they require an expert to add that much needed
                creative flare.</p>
